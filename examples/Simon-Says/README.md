# Simon Says — Memory Game 🎮

This is a fun and interactive **Simon Says** memory game built using **HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript (ES Modules)**.  
Players must observe and repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors — testing their memory and focus!

## Features

- 🎨 **Colorful animated buttons** for each level.
- 🧠 **Progressive difficulty** — sequence length increases with each correct round.
- ❌ **Game over feedback** with flashing animations.
- 🔁 **Restart option** to play again after losing.
- ⚡ Built using **plain HTML, CSS, and JS (no libraries or frameworks)**.

## Files

- `index.html` — main markup and game layout
- `styles.css` — visual design, colors, and animations
- `index.mjs` — core game logic using ES modules (sequence generation, user input, and level progression)

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox recommended).
2. Press 'Start Game' button to start the game.
3. Watch the color sequence shown by the game.
4. Repeat the sequence by clicking the color buttons in the same order.
5. Each level adds one more color to the sequence — try to remember them all!
6. If you click the wrong color, the game ends — press any key to restart.

## Notes

- The game uses **JavaScript timing functions** to display sequences with smooth delays.
- Fully responsive — works well on both **desktop and mobile** browsers.
