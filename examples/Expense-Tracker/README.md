# 💰 Expense Tracker

A simple and interactive **Expense Tracker** built using **HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript (ES Modules)**.  
It helps users manage their daily income and expenses, view summaries, and store data locally — all without a backend.

## Features

- ➕ **Add new transactions** — income or expense.  
- ✏️ **Edit transactions** — update existing entries easily.  
- ❌ **Delete transactions** you no longer need.  
- 💵 **Live balance summary** showing total, income, and expenses.  
- 💾 **Data persistence** using `localStorage` (no backend required).  
- 📱 **Clean and responsive UI** — works on both desktop and mobile.

## Files

- `index.html` — main structure and layout of the app.  
- `styles.css` — styling, layout, and responsive design.  
- `index.mjs` — handles core functionality like adding, editing, deleting, and storing transactions.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox recommended).  
2. Enter a **description** and **amount**.  
   - Use positive numbers for income (e.g., `+5000`).  
   - Use negative numbers for expenses (e.g., `-1200`).  
3. Click **Add Transaction** to save it.  
4. View your total **balance**, **income**, and **expense** at a glance.  
5. Edit or delete transactions anytime — all changes are saved automatically.

## Notes

- Data is stored locally in the browser using **localStorage**.  
- The app automatically loads your saved data on refresh.  
- Built entirely with **vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS** — no external libraries used.  
- Great for beginners learning **DOM manipulation, events, and localStorage**.
