# Whack-a-Mole — Reflex Game 🦫

This is a fun and interactive **Whack-a-Mole** reflex game built using **HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript (ES Modules)**.  
Players must click (or “whack”) the mole as it randomly pops out of one of the holes before it disappears — testing their speed and reaction time!

## Features

- 🎯 **Fast-paced gameplay** — moles appear randomly across the board.  
- ⏱️ **30-second timer** — challenge yourself to score as high as possible within the time limit.  
- 🧠 **Live score tracking** — updates instantly with each successful hit.  
- 💥 **Smooth animations** — CSS-based mole pop-up effect for a polished experience.  
- ⚡ Built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks)**.

## Files

- `index.html` — main structure and layout of the game board.  
- `styles.css` — visual design, layout grid, and animations.  
- `index.mjs` — game logic for mole appearance, scoring, and timer handling.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox recommended).  
2. Click the **“Start Game”** button to begin.  
3. Moles will pop up randomly in different holes — **click them as fast as you can!**  
4. Each successful hit gives you **+1 point**.  
5. After 30 seconds, the game ends and your **final score** is displayed.  
6. Click **“Start Game”** again to play another round.

## Notes

- Uses **JavaScript’s `setTimeout()`** for mole timing and random placement.  
- A great beginner project to understand **event handling, DOM updates, and randomization**.  
- Fully responsive — works on both **desktop and mobile** devices.
